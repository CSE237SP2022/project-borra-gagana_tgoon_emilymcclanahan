# Grade Calculator
## Project by Gagana Borra, Emily McClanahan, and Tom Goon

Java command line program that is fed in a text file with class assignment weights and a text file with grades and outputs the user's final grade.

## Iteration 1
- User Stories: 
 - Made sample .txt file for student's numerical grade
 - Made sample .txt file for overall class grade distribution weighting
 - Created methods necessary to read in both grades and weights .txt files in Java/Eclipse
 - Created methods to calculate and output percentage grade
 - Made unit tests for all current methods
 - Made bash script to compile and run
 
 Everything for this iteration should be functional. To run the bash script: ./gradecalculator.sh

## Iteration 2 To-do
- Create a method to output a letter grade based on a standardized grading scale and student's numerical grade
- Create a method to check and see if an extra credit assignment has been completed. If so, the student's grade will receive a +1%. If the extra credit was not completed, the student's grade does not increase.
